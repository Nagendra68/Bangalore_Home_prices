# Bangalore Home Price Prediction Web App  

This is a web application that predicts home prices in Bangalore based on user inputs. It uses a machine learning model trained on real estate data to provide accurate price predictions.  

## Features  
- Predicts house prices based on location, area, number of bedrooms, and other parameters.  
- User-friendly interface for entering input details.  
- Displays the predicted price instantly.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)  
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy  
- **Deployment**: REnder , Streamlit  

## How It Works  
1. The user provides input details like location, square footage, and number of bedrooms.  
2. The inputs are processed and fed into a pre-trained machine learning model.  
3. The model predicts the price and displays it on the web app.
